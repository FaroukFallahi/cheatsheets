# Help
- `:help` start help window
- `Ctrl + o` next help
- `Ctrl + i` prev help
    - when you enter :help some then :help some
    - then you can switch between the two by
    - those shortcuts
- `linewise` means the command operates on lines
- `characterwise` means it operates on characters

If unsure about the name of command, write the first part, like, :h q then
hit Ctrl + d to auto complete, then use TAB to move in them
