# What is LaTeX?
It's a document processor. I like it's features like intelligent linkings and
the fact that it's files are formatted in simple plain text files.

## Table of Contents
- [001 Basic document structure](./content/001_basic_document_structure.md)
- [002 Sections](./content/002_sections.md)
- [003 Text formatting](./content/003_text_formatting.md)
- [004 Lists](./content/004_lists.md)
