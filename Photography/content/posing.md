# Posing
These are based on courses i've seen on the subject (non is my own opinion).

## Posing guidlines
1. Closer to cam == bigger looking
1. foreshortening: don't point arms or anything toward or pointing away from cam
1. cam angle: shoot from above == bigger upper body and vice versa
1. wide angle lens exaggerates distance
1. wider lens can be used to make things that are farther away, smaller
1. headshots should not be shot with less than 70mm full frame
1. straight back and elongate neck (don't slouch)
1. crop at a narrowing point in body (like waist or just at top of the knee)
1. if you want to make someone so skinny then put one knee in front of the
   other (makes a triangle)
1. don't crop on a joint or just right beside it
1. feet > hips > shoulders > chin/head > hands (order of things to tell your
   model to fix)
1. in case of head turn to side, if body moves to the same side then the
   neck becomes longer visually
1. put women hair away from camera to the other side so the neck is visible
1. don't lay back, it makes neck shorter and not nice
1. girls, hip back upper body toward cam. guys, step forward upper body
   toward cam (aggresive)
1. straight on makes shoulders wider hence more muscular, to the side makes
   body tiny (for guys usually)
1. chin out removes double chin and defines jaw line better (make it subtle)
1. the previous point makes people do a chin up, in that case make it:
   chin out and down
1. body parts that are of two pieces (eg. feet, hand) if on different
   levels, will be more dramatic
1. avoid the whiteness of eyes (looking far away when standing by side)
1. men should be doing sth with their hands (makes comfortable)
1. for women crossing knee forward and having feet on toes gives them curves
   in buttocks
1. foot should be pointing in sides instead of at cam (gives dynamicity to
   the pose)
1. triangles make negative space and gives more dynamic poses
1. sexy poses tend to be curvier but editorial fashion is full of strong
   triangles and dynamic poses
1. nose should not pass the cheek line
1. don't put arms beside body, it emphasizes person's body width
1. over the shoulder looking back: make sure chin doesn't meet shoulder
   from that perspective
1. if you want dynamic pose, then go with asymmetry (but must be balanced)
1. different individuals have different body part sizes, so you should even
   that out. for ex. someone with big chest and small bottom must not lean
   forward too much
1. if subject has asymmetrical features don't shoot straight so that you
   won't emphasize it
1. girls, head tilt toward. guys, tilt away or a head turn and look the
   other way (turn head right, look left)
1. if someone has droopy eyes, then shoot it from higher angle so it has
   to look up at you
1. use hands to hide flaw, for ex. to hide huuuge double chin use hand
   under the jaw
1. hands and other body parts should not be major and take your attention
   from what you want to emphasis
1. It's all about squinch (take lower eye lid higher)
1. when crossing arms: fist behind means not open, fist showing means
   strong but open, soft hands open and soft

## For guys, these should be the goto poses first
1. sitting
1. standing
1. laying
1. leaning

## For girls, these must be considered
1. emphasize assets
1. weight on back leg, front knee bent, lean forward to cam
1. curves and negative space
1. soft hands, not obscuring face
1. chin out and down

## For couples
1. multiple points of interaction makes intimacy
1. go asymmetrical
1. they must match in proportion (make them both dominant (unless...))
1. tilt heads together to show attraction
1. tight crops are fine for intimacy
1. avoid noses being right together (touching or hiding behind each other)
1. white eye is common when they look at each other
1. fingers that come from nowhere are common in couple shots (look out!)
1. don't lean away from each other! intimacy guys, intimacy!
1. lean heads toward each other
1. when guy stands behind girl, to reduce height, he can open his legs
   wide (closeup)
1. use serious, gentle expressions to introduce closeness (i came up
   with this myself)

## For very young girls
1. hand on hips should be on different levels and hips should also go
   with it to relax shoulder
1. when laying on ground, top leg extended is less curve and vice versa
1. both hands fisted under chin makes girls look younger
1. when putting model against the wall, use negative space and make
   them lean on elbow instead of back
1. five goto poses: standing, closeup with hands in there, sitting,
   laying, leaning
1. girls like to look pretty

## For very young guys
1. because they are kids, they like to look big so no side shoulder shot
1. props are great for teens to utilize
1. occupy hands and arms (maybe with those props)
1. making a fist is always strong in men poses
1. guys like to look cool

## For mature guys
1. confident and relaxed expression
1. chair for sitting, wall for standing
1. have hands doing something

## For mature women
1. hands will show aging too much (try to avoid 'em)
1. subtle curves
1. chin out further

## For boudoir
1. curve and arch (boudoir poses are uncomfortable)
1. do pose, relax, repeat pose
1. hands caress body
1. vary eye contact (looking at cam means hey look at me, but
   looking away means you caught me)
1. standing, laying, sitting

## For plus size ppl
1. direct shape where you'll crop
1. avoid straight-on camera (wider always) (not side either,
   due to stomach size). go for 3/4

## For old couples
1. subtler than young couples
1. traditional poses first, then expand if they are comfortable

## For different height couples
1. sit
1. step and lean (line up legs so they look like one and then crop
   right top of the knee)
1. walking (shorter in foreground)
1. legs open apart for cropped shots

## For group shots
1. avoid symmetry to avoid dated shots (but keep balance)
1. avoid lots of hands on shoulders and creeping fingers
1. make triangles with their heads (very important), avoid lined up heads
1. taller people sit or in back (also obscure wider bodies)
1. body language to define people's relationships
1. in groups not everyone should look perfect, just try to make them pose
   better is enough
1. always start with one person and then build up by creating triangles

## For bridal parties
1. know family politics (divorced, multiple moms and dads, etc.)
1. triangles are not necessary here
1. start with bride and groom
1. direct hands last (people change it if they're tired)
1. symmetry for traditional and asymmetry for modern
1. make sure bride and groom rings are displayed (like those two
   hands are beside each other)
